# Introduction
4D Light Field material (4D-Light) is a light-field material dataset with a total of 1200 images. It contains 12 material categories (e.g. fur, fabric, water, etc), and each category has 100 images. It does
not provide an official train-test split.


# Splits
 For 4D-Light, werandomly selected 70 images in each category for training, and the rest 30 images for testing. According to the same proportion, we randomly divide the dataset into 4 splits.
