# Introduction
The Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) is an evolving collection of textural images in the wild, annotated with a series of human-centric attributes, inspired by the perceptual properties of textures. This data is made available to the computer vision community for research purposes.

# Splits
 we use officially provided train-test splits for DTD dataset.
